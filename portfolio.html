      <h3>Protagonist or Antagonist?</h3>
      <p> Click on the picture to the right to see if you are the protagonist or the antagonist in a Greek myth (if you transmigrated into one)! This project was my second coding project duirng the Girls Who Code SIP program in 2021. For this project we learned to incorporate HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a functioning quiz. The button color change and the display result button were particularly tricky.</p>
      <p>My first project in the program is this website you're on right now! </p>

      <h3>Teen Dating Violence and Toxic Relationships</h3>
      <p> Check out my website on teen dating violence and abusive relationships! I built this website during the summer of 2021 at Girls Who Code through html, css, and javascript. I choose the topic of teen dating violence and toxic relationship because abusive behaviors, especially in teenage relationships, are not talked about or viewed as seriously as adult relationships.</p>
      <p>Teen dating violence can happen to anyone and people need to be able to recognize the warning signs.</p>

    <h2>Ceramics</h2>
    <p>(Some of my proudest projects are the ceramics that I made during my first year in middle school. My ceramics/art teacher, Ms. Ginsberg, was extremely nice.)</p>

      <h3>Gold Fish</h3>
      <p>For this particular project, I started with molding the body, then attaching the fins and the tail. The details are much more time consuming since I had to sculpt the scales.</p>

      <h3>Flower Plate</h3>
      <p>The art on this one was done in imitation of Georgia O'Keeffe's art style. I loved doing the gradation coloring, but the background wasn't as smooth as I would've liked.</p>

      <img class="goldfish"

      <h3>Leaf Plate</h3>
      <p>This was such a fun project! Each of the student got a lettuce leaf, and it is with that actual leaf that we made the unique pattern and indentation on the clay itself. The upperside is then painted with a sponge. </p>

    <h3>Woman with the hat</h3>
    <p>Here's one of my recent digital art work. The software that I used is Clip Studio Paint. I've only just started learning digital art, so there's still so much for me to learn and explore, but it's so exciting! I did two versions of the same line drawing, experimenting with different brushes.</p>

    src="assets/illustrationcolor.jpeg" alt="a digital drawing of a woman looking over her shoulder, her left hand holding a pen. She is wearing a broad rimmed hat colored in purple, and a purple dress with a fluffy scarf around her shoulder. The background is yellow with splotches.">
